# 🎧 OTT Solutions – Live Dashboard

This project contains a responsive and interactive Live Dashboard for OTT music analytics. It visualizes key metrics such as revenue contribution, language distribution, top-performing songs, artist comparisons, stream efficiency, and royalty vs admin expenses. Built with HTML, CSS, and Plotly.js, the dashboard uses a card-based grid layout and integrates smoothly with Flask/Django via templating (using `url_for`).
