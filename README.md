# 🎧 OTT Solutions – Live Dashboard

This project contains a responsive and interactive Live Dashboard for OTT music analytics. It visualizes key metrics such as revenue contribution, language distribution, top-performing songs, artist comparisons, stream efficiency, and royalty vs admin expenses. Built with HTML, CSS, and Plotly.js, the dashboard uses a card-based grid layout and integrates smoothly with Flask/Django via templating (using `url_for`).

## Features
- **Revenue Contribution by Platform** – Donut chart comparing Airtel, JioSaavn, and Wynk revenue.
- **Language Distribution** – Shows song counts across major Indian and international languages.
- **Top Songs by Revenue** – Ranks songs using an interactive bar chart.
- **Artist Performance Comparison** – Full-width chart comparing artist revenue split across DSPs.
- **Streams vs Income Efficiency** – Scatter plot mapping song streams to income efficiency.
- **Royalty vs Admin Expenses** – Grouped bar chart comparing royalty payout and admin costs per song.
